# ClassicalNonlinearSystems
This repository contains code for implementing the classical (construction of the Hermitian form of the Fokker-Planck matrix) and quantum (QPE + DD + VQSVD) subroutines for the paper "Steady-State Statistics of Classical Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices". 

The following versions of Qiskit software are needed to run simulations: 
a) qiskit-terra: 0.24.0;
b) qiskit-aer: 0.12.0;
c) qiskit-ibmq-provider: 0.20.2;
d) qiskit: 0.43.0.
