# Classical Nonlinear Systems
This repository contains code to implement the classical (construction of the Hermitian form of the Fokker-Planck operator matrix) and quantum (QPE + VQSVD) subroutines for the paper ***Steady-State Statistics of Classical Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices***. 

**Authors**: Y. M. Lokare, D. Wei, L. Chan, B. M. Rubenstein, and J. B. Marston. 

The following versions of Qiskit software are needed to run numerical simulations: 
a) qiskit-terra: 0.24.0;
b) qiskit-aer: 0.12.0;
c) qiskit-ibmq-provider: 0.20.2;
d) qiskit: 0.43.0. 

We use the ***poetry*** package management system to manage all package dependencies. 

**Note**: The DD analysis and/or results contained in this repository are irrelevant for the present study.
